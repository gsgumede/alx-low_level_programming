- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- gcc gnu89
## Files
**[0-memset.c ](0-memset.c )** - a function that fills memory with a constant byte  
**[ 1-memcpy.c]( 1-memcpy.c)** -  a function that copies memory area  
**[2-strchr.c](2-strchr.c)** -  a function that locates a character in a string  
**[3-strspn.c](3-strspn.c)** - a function that gets the length of a prefix substring  
**[ 4-strpbrk.c]( 4-strpbrk.c)** - a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes  
**[5-strstr.c](5-strstr.c)** - a function that locates a substring  
**[7-print_chessboard.c](7-print_chessboard.c)** - a function that prints the chessboard  
**[8-print_diagsums.c](8-print_diagsums.c)** - a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers  
**[100-set_string.c](100-set_string.c)** - a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char  
**[101-crackme_password ](101-crackme_password )** -  a file that contains the password for the crackme2 executable  
**[main.h](main.h)** - header file
